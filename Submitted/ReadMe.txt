Game Description
----------------
  Two treasure hunters find a cursed treasure that, when they break it, their bodies 
  get merged into one. In order to separate their bodies, the must find all the 
  shattered pieces and put the treasure back together while avoiding the Minotaur 
  that they awoke!


Feeling
-------
  The feeling we were hoping for was a challenging cooperative retro game. We hoped
  to make players work together for a singular cause, while creating tension and constant 
  movement with an undefeatable Minotaur. We also hoped to give it an 16-bit throw 
  back feel.
